Here are MacOS Services. Download them and install into USER/Library/Services. They will then be available from the Services menu of the Finder or on a right-click.

Note that if files other than PDF documents are within the selection, the service will not appear in the menu.

PRO TIP: The files are passed to the service in the order that they appear in the Finder. So re-ordering the files (e.g. ascending, descending, Name, Date modified, etc) will alter the order that they are processed. This may be useful/relevant when performing actions like Combining PDFs or Adding Index Numbers.

Some of the scripts inside the workflows have options that can be altered. Double-click on the workflow to open it in Automator, and just edit the text accordingly.
